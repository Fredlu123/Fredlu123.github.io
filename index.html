	 <p style="text-align: left;padding: 10px;text-indent:2em;">The birthday paradox refers to the probability that at least two people out of 23 people have the same birthday is greater than 50%. For example, in a 30-person elementary school class, there is a 70% probability that two people have the same birthday. For a large class of 60 people, this probability is greater than 99%.</p>
